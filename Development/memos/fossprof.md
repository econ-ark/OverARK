# FREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE PROJECT FUND (FOSSPROF)

The Johns Hopkins University Open Source Programs Office (OSPO) is excited to announce the launch of the Free and Open Source Software Project Fund (FOSSProF). FOSSProF is a community-driven program that will provide funding of up to $50,000 to support OSS practitioners on campus and to help the OSPO discover new ways to effectively contribute to OSS program success.

FOSSProF is open to all groups at Hopkins that are working on creating, developing, or contributing to open source projects. To participate, simply submit a proposal via the below web form . Interviews and proposal review will happen on a rolling basis through the fall semester, with projects designed to execute during the spring semester, wrapping up in May.

All types of proposals will be considered; including, but not limited to, projects designed to:

Improve software quality, e.g. via bug fixes, updated documentation, improved user experience, or accessibility testing and improvements
Increase functionality, including new features, integrations, or plug-ins
Increase visibility and adoption through value proposition development, market analysis, or promotional activities
Improve community engagement by holding events, creating communications plans, or developing new community-led training programs
Increase learning and development; for example, by providing space for program staff to create new features requiring new skillsets or program materials requiring new tools
Improve project governance, by establishing or improving decision-making structures or policies
Assess the current status of any of the above in order to create a baseline from which to launch a project
Have an idea but need help shaping it into a proposal? We are here to help! Reach out to <ospo@jhu.edu> to set up a time to meet with OSPO staff for assistance.

OSPO staff will work with all participating programs to identify project goals and hoped-for outcomes; develop project budgets, timelines, work plans, and evaluation methods; and write final project reports. The OSPO will also work collaboratively with participating programs to define useful metrics for project assessment, leveraging existing tools from Bitergia, CHAOSS, and GitHub for metrics or developing novel methodologies as needed.

FOSSProF is generously funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. Help us build a thriving open source community at Hopkins!

## Request Form

### Problem Statement(Required)

Please provide a clear and concise description of the problem or need that your project is addressing or the research topic you are considering. (1000 max characters)

The Economics profession has fallen behind other fields in software development and reproducibility practices. With insufficient software engineering training, economists are accustomed to writing new software from scratch. This practice of ‘reinventing the wheel’ inevitably introduces bugs and leads to having little concern about the reproducibility of computational results. Other disciplines have adapted to modern software development methods, and it is time for Economics to catch up.

Poor software development practices also slow down the advancement of Economics as a science. When researchers cannot reproduce the results of a paper, they are unable to build on the work of others, which leads to wasted time and effort and slows down progress. Additionally, when researchers cannot reproduce the results of a paper, they are unable to verify the validity of said results. This leads to a lack of trust in the research, which can have a negative impact on the influence of the field.

To address the problem discussed above, Econ-ARK has been working on developing a set of standards and tools for reproducibility in our own work in Economics. Our reproducibility initiative is called REMARK, which stands for "R[eplications/eproductions] and Explorations Made using ARK". The term REMARK is used to represent the standard, as well as any project that follows the standard. The objective of REMARKs is to be self-contained and complete projects, whose contents should be executable by anyone on any computer that meets a minimal set of requirements and software.  

The goal of this project is to expand the REMARK standard in two main ways. First, we will extend the REMARK tool set to allow for the use of modern scientific publishing technologies such as Jupyter notebooks and MyST markdown, which are integral parts of the Executable Books ecosystem. Currently, the project recommends the use of LaTeX, which is somewhat outdated and not very user friendly. Second, we will extend the REMARK standard to integrate with the Open Journals infrastructure, which provides a platform for open source, open access journals built from source on GitHub. The Open Journals infrastructure is used by the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) and several other journals. A long-term objective of the REMARK project is to evolve beyond its current status as an internal standard for reproducibility of Econ-ARK projects into a set of tools and standards that can be used by a journal of open source economics software.

To achieve these goals, we will need to engage and collaborate with several open source projects and domain experts. We will need to work with Executable Books to integrate their tool set into REMARKs. We will also need to work with Open Journals to extend their infrastructure to support the REMARK standard. Finally, we will need to work with domain experts in economics to ensure that the REMARK standard is sufficient to meet the needs of the economics community.

We will contract and interact with "Curvenote", a consulting company launched by Rowan Cockett and Steve Purves who are core members of the Executable Books ecosystem and developers of MyST markdown. Curvenote will build necessary extensions to the Open Journals infrastructure to support the REMARK standard. Additionally, Curvenote will add REMARK support for MyST markdown to make the writing and publication process easier for researchers and allow REMARKs to have dynamic and interactive features. We budget $25,000 for this work.

We will retain "Don't Use This Code" (DUTC), a training, coaching, and consulting company led by James Powell and Cameron Riddell. DUTC have done previous work on the REMARK standard and are familiar with the project's goals and objectives. DUTC will work on the maintenance and sustainability of the REMARK standard beyond the duration of this grant, as well as assist in planning for the launch and promotion of REMARK to a broader audience. We budget $15,000 for this work.

In order to promote REMARK and its mission of reproducibility in Economics, we will host a workshop and dinner associated with a major economics conference, such as the American Economics Association and the Econometric Society meetings. The approximate budget for the workshop is $3,400.

Finally, we will hire up to 3 graduate Economics students to produce REMARKs (reproductions) of existing papers from the Economics faculty at Johns Hopkins University. Their work will inform the development of the REMARK standard and will serve as examples for other researchers to follow. The approximate budget for this work is $6,600.

All the work produced under this grant will be open source and available to the public. Principal Investigators and Econ-ARK will acknowledge the support of the Johns Hopkins University Open Source Programs Office in all publications and presentations related to this work.

### Project Impact(Required)

Please describe the impact that you hope the project will have on your program, the university community, or the open source community. (1000 max characters)

The goals described in this proposal will have a significant impact on the JHU Economics Department. By extending the REMARK standard, faculty and students will be able to publish their research in a reproducible manner, which will allow for quick and easy verification of their results and increase the influence of their research.

Beyond the Economics department, the REMARK has the potential to impact the university community at large, by allowing researchers in other fields to publish their reproducible research in a manner that is accessible to the public.

Finally, the REMARK standard has the potential to impact the open source community by providing a reproducibility standard for open source scientific software. While the REMARK standard is currently focused on Economics, it can and should be extended to other programming languages and fields of study. By working with Executable Books and Open Journals, we will improve REMARK and make it easier for other fields to adopt it.
