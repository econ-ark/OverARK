Dear [person]:

The next phase of the Econ-ARK project is to develop something like the DYNARE `mod file` standard, but capable of representing ANY Markov decision problem (including, but not limited to, any Bellman problem). 

- The chief purpose of this email is to ask if you would be willing to advise us as we pursue this goal.

You can find a detailed overview of what we have done and what we intend to do in our [roadmap](https://github.com/econ-ark/OverARK/blob/master/roadmap/past-and-future.md).

The role we hope you will play is as a member of the [working-group](https://github.com/econ-ark/OverARK/blob/master/roadmap/past-and-future.md). Briefly, we will engage with working group members jointly via occasional (every 2-3 months) Zoom meetings, via an in-person meeting (maybe just before next summer's CEF meetings in Costa Rica), and (to the extent convenient for each working group member), one-on-one as we try to implement your ideas.

If you agree to join the working group, we have one more ask. 

We are applying for a grant from the Sloan Foundation, and Sloan's guidelines say: "If the success of the project depends on the support of key figures or institutions other than the project lead or project team, the proposal must include an appendix with a letter from each, articulating the nature of their relationship to the project and their understanding of the role they expect to play in the projectâ€™s success." The letter should be addressed to Daniel L. Goroff, Economics Program Director, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.

- Your letter can be short, perhaps even just saying something like, "I have agreed to serve on the Econ-ARK [working group](https://github.com/econ-ark/OverARK/blob/master/roadmap/past-and-future.md) and expect that I will be able to fulfill the duties expected of me in that capacity." Naturally, if you want to be more effusive, we would not object.
