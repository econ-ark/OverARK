Dear John:

The next phase of the Econ-ARK project aims to develop something like the DYNARE `mod file` syntax, but capable of representing ANY Markov decision problem (including, but not limited to, any Bellman problem). The chief purpose of this email is to ask if you would be willing to help advise us as we pursue this goal.

You can find an overview of what we have done and what we intend to do at our [this link]().

The role we hope you can play is described in 



I'm using the word `representing` because the idea is NOT to tie the model representation to any specific solution method or toolkit. Instead, it is to provide a complete specification of the problem, which could be ingested by ANY compatible solution engine, which could then go to work solving the problem. 

We plan to use the tools we have already developed in the HARK toolkit to provide an example solution engine capable of solving the particular models we know our tools can solve. We also aim to provide examples of how to use existing tools, like Michael Reiter's toolkit and Robert Kirkby's VFI toolkit and Pablo Winant's Dolo, as the solution engine for models that they are capable of handling.

Developing a model-description standard like this will require iterative feedback from economists with experience and knowledge about the theoretical foundations, scope, and breadth of dynamic modeling. We would like you to participate in this process as part of a working group, periodically providing constructive criticism on draft versions of the language specification. For example, feedback on whether it can encompass the range of models you have studied (or have considered) in your own projects. 

We have already developed a very primitive sketch of such a standard, which builds on Winant's Dolo framework. The next step (assuming we continue to have funding) is to convene an in-person meeting for the working group to help guide us in further development of the standard.

We are applying for a grant from the Sloan Foundation to pursue this project. Sloan's guidelines say: "If the success of the project depends on the support of key figures or institutions other than the project lead or project team, the proposal must include an appendix with a letter from each, articulating the nature of their relationship to the project and their understanding of the role they expect to play in the projectâ€™s success."

If you are willing to help, your letter can be addressed to Daniel L. Goroff, Economics Program Director, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. I have attached a memo that summarizes Econ-ARK's work so far, and provides some additional details about our current direction and this project.
