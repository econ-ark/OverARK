# Working Group on Model Development

A critical part of the [roadmap](https://github.com/econ-ark/OverARK/blob/master/roadmap/past-and-future.md#how-were-going-to-do-it) for the development of the [Econ-ARK](https://econ-ark.org/) [*modeling language*](https://ampl.com/wp-content/uploads/amlopt.pdf) is engagement with respected members of the profession who can provide us guidance and feedback.

Here are some details about how we expect to engage with the "working group" we will form to that end.

-   Zoom consultations once every 2-3 months to describe our progress and solicit feedback

-   Attendance (ideally, in person; if necessary, electronically) in a workshop, maybe in the spring or summer of 2025, at which we will present our preliminary rough sketch of the modeling language framework, and ask the participants to help us formulate an agenda for where to go.

-   To the extent feasible and convenient for each working group member, followup engagement after Zoom meetings or the in-person conference to pursue recommendations or ideas developed in these venues
